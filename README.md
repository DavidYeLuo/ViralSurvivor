## Post-Jam Thoughts
* Plan without sacrificing flexibility/ plan with greater breadth, less depth?
* This game jam, we've tried learning data-oriented design, which led to cramming all logic into one file. Turns out it is easier to follow than OOP approach. It was slightly slower to develop, but the development process is something I want to try out more. Overall, it worked out pretty well for a small game jam.
